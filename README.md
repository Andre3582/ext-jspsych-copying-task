# ext-jspsych-copying-task
A jsPsych plugin for displaying a basic copying task 

Download the jsPsych library from https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych

Add the plugin (the .js file) to the 'dist' folder next to all other built in jsPsych plugins.

Add the .html file to the 'examples' folder.

Open and run the .html file to see some examples of how a task can be set up and what it looks like.

Note that this plugin is built with fabric.js. Currently it is imported via www.unpkg.com for ease of use, but it means you need an intenet connection to run the plugin. You can of course download fabric.js and save it locally.
