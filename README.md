# ext-jspsych-copying-task
A jsPsych plugin for displaying a basic copying task 

Add the plugin (the .js file) to the 'dist' folder next to all other built in jsPsych plugins
Add the .html file to the 'examples' folder in the jsPsych.

Open and run the .html file to see some examples of how a task can be set up and what it looks like.

Note that this plugin is built with fabric.js. Currently it is imported via www.unpkg.com for ease of use, but it mean you need an intenet connection to run the plugin. You can of course download fabric.js and save it locally.
